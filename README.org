[[./readme/elm.gif]]

** What is it?
A homepage/new tab page written in Elm.
It uses the colors from the current ~pywal~ theme, so ~$HOME/.cache/wal/colors.css~.
It stores bookmarks as key/value pairs in LocalStorage.
You can filter on bookmarks by name/url.

** Will you add rearranging bookmarks?
No, that's why there's a filter. But I might make it support regex.
